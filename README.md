# Review-of-Gryonoides

This repository contains the Darwin Core Archives for <i>Gryonoides specimens</i> contained in the publication "Biology and taxonomy of Teleasinae: Review of <i>Gryonoides</i> Dodd 1920 (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae)
". The archive was produced by the authors from data contained in mx (Yoder et al. 2006–present).

### Description
Darwin core archives have been emerged as the accepted data sharing standard forsharing occurrence data about organisms. These occurrences could be observations or specimens in natural history collections. The standard is applied by natural history collections worldwide to share their data between various repositories, including Global Biodiversity Information Faculty (GBIF) and Integrated Digitized Bio collections (iDigBio). Here, we describe a method for publishing the material examined as a DarwinCore Archive, accessible for data aggregators and conforming to community standards. This method can be used for any occurrence dataset, either as the material examined, species monitoring observation records, ecology publication or natural history collection data. Darwin core packages - interconnected text files - represents the end products of digitization projects. Currently, these files are stored on a variety of primary data repositories and are ”harvested” by data aggregators usually trough the content management systems used during digitization efforts.
