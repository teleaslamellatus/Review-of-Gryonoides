# Review-of-Gryonoides

This repository contains the Darwin Core Archives for Gryonoides specimens contained in the publication "...". The archive was produced by the authors from data contained in TaxonWorks

### Description
Darwin core archives have been emerged as the accepted data sharing standard forsharing occurrence data about organisms. These occurrences could be observations orspecimens in natural history collections. The standard is applied by natural historycollections worldwide to share their data between various repositories, including GlobalBiodiversity Information Faculty (GBIF) and Integrated Digitized Bio collections(iDigBio). Here we describe a method for publishing the material examined as a DarwinCore Archive, accessable for data aggregators and conforming to community standards.This method can be used for any occurrence dataset, either as a the material examined,species monitoring observation records, ecology publication or natural history collectiondata.Darwin core packages - interconnected text files - represents the end products ofdigitization projects. Currently, these files are stored on a variety of primary datarepositories and are ”harvested” by data aggregators usually trough the contentmanagement systems used during digitization efforts.
